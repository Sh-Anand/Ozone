Ozone
=====
> "OS one", O3

Ozone is a [multikernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multikernel) operating system running on the ARM-based Toradex
iMX.8 board as the project of the [Advance Operating Systems](README.AOS) at ETHZ.
It is built on a simplified version of [Barrelfish](barrelfish.org), an open-source multikernel developed at ETHZ.
